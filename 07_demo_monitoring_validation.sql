-- DEMO MONITORING AND VALIDATION QUERIES - STREAMS & TASKS EDITION
-- =============================================================================
-- These queries demonstrate the key differences between:
-- - Stage tables (complete historical data)
-- - Latest data tables (maintained by Streams & Tasks)
-- And shows monitoring of the entire Snowpipe â†’ Streams â†’ Tasks pipeline
-- =============================================================================

-- PREREQUISITES: 
-- 1. All setup scripts (01-05B) have been run successfully
-- 2. JSON files have been uploaded and processed by Snowpipe
-- 3. Streams are capturing changes and Tasks are processing them
-- 4. Latest data tables are being maintained by the Tasks

-- Set context
